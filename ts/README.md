# Typescript Interview

## Setup

Ahead of the pair programming interview, clone this repository to your local machine and follow these instructions to 
get a development environment configured. Plan to use your preferred code editor and share your screen during the 
pair programming exercise. Do not fork this repository or publish your changes publicly as we will be using this 
repository for other interviews.

**Before proceeding with the setup, make sure to change into `ts` directory.**

### Setup using Node and NPM

Please ensure you have a recent version of Node and NPM installed on your local system. 

#### Install dependencies

Run `npm install` to install the required packages for Jest and Typescript.

#### Run tests

You can use `npm run test` to run all test cases using `Jest`.

## Ready to go?

Read through the documentation included in `./__tests__/DailyAvailabilityTest.test.ts` and `./src/DailyAvailability.ts` ahead of your interview.
During the interview, you and your partner will complete the functionality outlined in the unit tests.

If you are not familiar with Jest, consider familiarizing yourself with the [documentation on their website](https://jestjs.io/).
